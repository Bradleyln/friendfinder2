# friendfinder

This app takes user input and from a 10 question quiz and then calculates the answers to compare to an array of other users to match the most compatible friends. There are 2 default USers and the rest are gathered in the heroku app to compare the user taking the quiz to the 2 defaults as well as the others who have taken the quiz. the next step that i did not yet get to is to gather the data on a mysql database to retain users between browser sessions.
